    <h1> Open the Console to see the things printed. </h1>
    <h2>How to Use Visual Studio Code</h2> <br>
    <p> First, create a folder on your computer. <br>
         After that, select the folder you just created and upload it to VSC. <br> 
    Next, right click under to folder's name and click "New File". <br>
    Then, name the new file (If I wanted a HTML file, I would name it "index.html"). <br>
    Lastly, code!</p> <br>
    <h2>The Console Screen</h2> <br>
    <p> The console screen is very helpful because if something is printed on it, it will stay on unless you delete the code (console.log()).
         You can also automatically do many calculations, replace letters/words, join two strings together,
          automatically capitalize/lowercase a word, and much more. <br> <br>
           To open the console screen you right click any webpage and click "inspect". 
           Then navigate to the console tab and there you will be able to see the things you have printed. <br> <br>
           To print something on the console, we use "console.log();". 
           For example, if I wanted to print "Hello" on the console, I would type "console.log(Hello);", and it will show up.
            You can check right now! Using the steps listed above, open the console screen. Everything printed on there will show up.
